# Card Curation Backlog

Master checklist of cards to hand-curate into `data/cards/`, following [curation-guide.md](curation-guide.md). Each entry shows the suggested file path slug. Check a card off only when its YAML reaches `confidence: high`.

**This file is the tracking source of truth:** every file in `data/cards/` must appear here (the validator warns if one doesn't), and no card counts as done until a human has verified it against issuer terms — AI-drafted files are a starting point, not data.

---

## ⚠️ Drafted but NOT human-verified — do these first

These files already exist in `data/cards/` with real-looking numbers, drafted by AI from model knowledge with **no sources actually checked**. Until verified, they are plausible, not true. Verify each against the issuer's own pages, fix the `sources` entries, and bump `confidence` to `high`:

- [ ] Chase Freedom Flex — `data/cards/chase/freedom-flex.yaml`
- [ ] Chase Sapphire Preferred — `data/cards/chase/sapphire-preferred.yaml`
- [ ] Amex Blue Cash Preferred — `data/cards/amex/blue-cash-preferred.yaml`
- [ ] Amex Gold — `data/cards/amex/gold.yaml`
- [ ] Citi Double Cash — `data/cards/citi/double-cash.yaml`
- [ ] Capital One Venture X — `data/cards/capital-one/venture-x.yaml`
- [ ] Wells Fargo Active Cash — `data/cards/wells-fargo/active-cash.yaml`

Scope notes:
- **US consumer cards** in the main list, including **closed-loop store cards** (Target, Amazon Store Card, etc. — curated with the schema's `closed_loop` block) since they're worth recommending in combination with open-loop cards when a big share of someone's spend is at that merchant, and **credit-builder/secured cards** (curated with `approval.credit_tier: building`) so users with thin or damaged credit still get recommendations they can actually be approved for.
- Cards no longer open to new applicants (e.g. Amex EveryDay, US Bank Altitude Reserve) are excluded; the optimizer recommends cards people can actually get. If one is re-opened, add it.
- Product names, fees, and even issuers change (e.g. Bilt's issuer transition) — treat this list itself as needing verification during curation.

Suggested priority: **Tier 1** (the flat-rate + everyday-category cards most Americans actually hold) → **Tier 2** (premium travel + points ecosystems) → **Tier 3** (co-branded airline/hotel, store cards) → **Tier 4** (student/secured/credit-builder, niche).

## Store / closed-loop cards (use the schema's `closed_loop` block)

Usable only at their merchant, but often 5%-level rewards there — recommendable alongside open-loop cards when a big share of the user's spend is at that merchant. Verify current issuers; store-card portfolios get sold between banks often.

- [ ] Target Circle Card (TD Bank) — `data/cards/td-bank/target-circle`
- [ ] Amazon Store Card / Prime Store Card (Synchrony) — `data/cards/synchrony/amazon-store`
- [ ] My Best Buy Card (Citi) — `data/cards/citi/best-buy`

- [ ] Kohl's Card (Capital One) — `data/cards/capital-one/kohls`
- [ ] Macy's Card (Citi) — `data/cards/citi/macys`
- [ ] Gap Good Rewards / Old Navy (Barclays) — `data/cards/barclays/gap-good-rewards`
- [ ] Nordstrom Card (TD Bank) — `data/cards/td-bank/nordstrom`

> Note: many of these have both a store-only version and an open-loop Visa/Mastercard version (e.g. Nordstrom, Verizon historically). Curate them as separate files — one with `closed_loop`, one without.

## Credit-builder & secured cards (use `approval.credit_tier: building`)

In scope so users with thin/damaged credit get real recommendations. Rewards are secondary here; approval accessibility is the point.

- [ ] Discover it Secured — `data/cards/discover/it-secured` *(also listed under Discover)*
- [ ] Capital One Platinum Secured — `data/cards/capital-one/platinum-secured`
- [ ] Capital One Quicksilver Secured — `data/cards/capital-one/quicksilver-secured`

- [ ] Self Visa Credit Card — `data/cards/self/visa`
- [ ] OpenSky Secured Visa — `data/cards/opensky/secured-visa`
- [ ] Mission Lane Visa — `data/cards/mission-lane/visa`
- [ ] Petal 2 Visa — `data/cards/petal/petal-2` *(verify still open to new applicants)*
- [ ] BankAmericard Secured — `data/cards/bank-of-america/bankamericard-secured`

## Invite-only / by-invitation cards (separate — not recommendable by the optimizer)

These can't be applied for, so the optimizer should never recommend them; curate only if we later add a "value my existing cards" mode.

- Amex Centurion ("Black Card") — invitation only
- J.P. Morgan Reserve — invitation only (Chase Private Client / J.P. Morgan relationship)

## Business cards (separate — out of MVP scope)

Personal-spend optimization is the MVP; business cards involve different eligibility and spend patterns. Parking the common ones here for a future mode:

- Chase Ink Business Cash / Unlimited / Preferred / Premier
- Amex Blue Business Plus / Blue Business Cash / Business Gold / Business Platinum
- Capital One Spark Cash Plus / Spark Miles / Venture X Business
- U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash / Business Altitude Connect
- Bank of America Business Advantage Customized Cash / Unlimited Cash / Travel Rewards
- Citi AAdvantage Business / CitiBusiness cards
- Barclays AAdvantage Aviator Business
- Amex Delta SkyMiles Business (Gold/Platinum/Reserve), Hilton Business, Marriott Business
- Chase United Business / Southwest Business (Premier/Performance)

## Student cards (Tier 4)

- [ ] Discover it Student Cash Back — `data/cards/discover/it-student-cash-back` *(also listed under Discover)*
- [ ] Discover it Student Chrome — `data/cards/discover/it-student-chrome`
- [ ] Capital One Savor Student — `data/cards/capital-one/savor-student`
- [ ] Bank of America Customized Cash for Students — `data/cards/bank-of-america/customized-cash-students`
- Chase Freedom Rise (listed under Chase — aimed at new-to-credit)
