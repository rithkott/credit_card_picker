# Card Curation Backlog

Master checklist of cards to hand-curate into `data/cards/`, following [curation-guide.md](curation-guide.md). Each entry shows the suggested file path slug. Check a card off only when its YAML reaches `confidence: high`.

**This file is the tracking source of truth:** every file in `data/cards/` must appear here (the validator warns if one doesn't), and no card counts as done until a human has verified it against issuer terms — AI-drafted files are a starting point, not data.

**Status markers**:

- `[ ]` not added — no file in `data/cards/` yet
- `[~]` AI-drafted — file exists but `confidence: low`; numbers are plausible, not verified
- `[x]` human-verified — a person checked every number against issuer terms; `confidence: high`
- `[/]` Up-To-Date terms sheet present in data/offer_files for AI parsing

---

Scope notes:
- **US consumer cards** in the main list, including **closed-loop store cards** (Target, Amazon Store Card, etc. — curated with the schema's `closed_loop` block) since they're worth recommending in combination with open-loop cards when a big share of someone's spend is at that merchant, and **credit-builder/secured cards** (curated with `approval.credit_tier: building`) so users with thin or damaged credit still get recommendations they can actually be approved for.
- Cards no longer open to new applicants (e.g. Amex EveryDay, US Bank Altitude Reserve) are excluded; the optimizer recommends cards people can actually get. If one is re-opened, add it.
- Product names, fees, and even issuers change (e.g. Bilt's issuer transition) — treat this list itself as needing verification during curation.

Suggested priority: **Tier 1** (the flat-rate + everyday-category cards most Americans actually hold) → **Tier 2** (premium travel + points ecosystems) → **Tier 3** (co-branded airline/hotel, store cards) → **Tier 4** (student/secured/credit-builder, niche).

## Store / closed-loop cards (use the schema's `closed_loop` block)

Usable only at their merchant, but often 5%-level rewards there — recommendable alongside open-loop cards when a big share of the user's spend is at that merchant. Verify current issuers; store-card portfolios get sold between banks often.

- [ ] Target Circle Card (TD Bank) — `data/cards/td-bank/target-circle`
- [ ] Amazon Store Card / Prime Store Card (Synchrony) — `data/cards/synchrony/amazon-store`

> Note: many of these have both a store-only version and an open-loop Visa/Mastercard version (e.g. Nordstrom, Verizon historically). Curate them as separate files — one with `closed_loop`, one without.

## Announced but not yet open (watch list — do NOT curate until applications open)

Per industry press (as of 2026-07). Move into the main list once live:

- Robinhood Platinum Card (announced)
- Chime Prime (announced — 5% categories, $1,500/mo cap reported)
- American Express Fanatics card (announced)
- Rumored, unconfirmed: Chase premium Hyatt card, Capital One "Savor X", Wells Fargo Autograph Beyond, Amex ultra-premium Delta

## Invite-only / by-invitation cards (separate — not recommendable by the optimizer)

These can't be applied for, so the optimizer should never recommend them; curate only if we later add a "value my existing cards" mode.

- Amex Centurion ("Black Card") — invitation only
- J.P. Morgan Reserve — invitation only (Chase Private Client / J.P. Morgan relationship)

## Business cards (separate — out of MVP scope)

Personal-spend optimization is the MVP; business cards involve different eligibility and spend patterns. Parking the common ones here for a future mode:

- Chase Ink Business Cash / Unlimited / Preferred / Premier
- Amex Blue Business Plus / Blue Business Cash / Business Gold / Business Platinum
- Capital One Spark Cash Plus / Spark Miles / Venture X Business
- U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash / Business Altitude Connect
- Bank of America Business Advantage Customized Cash / Unlimited Cash / Travel Rewards
